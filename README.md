# Booru Wizard

This piece of software is meant to generate a wizard with which the user may choose metadata for various images. The metadata will be that associated with the various \*booru style sites; Danbooru, Gelbooru, etc.

So far, this entails:

* Title

* Source

* Safety rating

* Tags

Prompts displayed by the wizard can be manually determined by the user through the use of a configuration file. The default one included with this software is intended to be self-documenting, and explain the format, in addition to providing examples.

To anyone outside of the hair-fetish community, note that this default configuration file is specifically intended for organizing hair-fetish themed works. Should the software become more popular outside of this community, I might begin using a more generic default configuration.

Metadata output from this software is in a series of .json files which correspond to each image opened. They are given the same name, but with `.json` appended to them. When the software is restarted, these same files are read to restore its previous state.

This software was originally designed to be used in conjunction with the uploader userscript at: https://github.com/NetDenizen/Booru-mass-uploader

Other uploading options might be implemented later, largely depending on how well that option meets the needs of its users.

Finally, included with each release should be a file called `imgbrd-grabber_log_template.json`, which may be used as a template for the logging feature for imgbrd-grabber utility at https://github.com/Bionus/imgbrd-grabber to allow the software to import data from existing \*booru sites. Note that the `source` field will refer back to the original \*booru page, not the source listed in that page.

For reference is `output_schema.json`, which specifies the format which all metadata representations handled by the software must follow.

## Installation

These basic steps may be followed to get both the wizard software, and the uploader userscript installed and running.

### booru-wizard

1. Download the packaged version for your respective operating system. If in doubt, you should probably choose Windows 32-bit. These links will be updated on each release:

   * [Windows 64-bit](https://github.com/NetDenizen/booru-wizard/releases/download/1.0/booru-wizard-1.0-x86_64-windows.zip)
   * [Windows 32-bit](https://github.com/NetDenizen/booru-wizard/releases/download/1.0/booru-wizard-1.0-x86-windows.zip)
   * [Linux 64-bit](https://github.com/NetDenizen/booru-wizard/releases/download/1.0/booru-wizard-1.0-x86_64-linux.tar.gz)

2. Extract the archive to the directory of your choice.

3. `run.bat` (on Windows) or `run.sh` (on Linux) may be used to run the software with the default configuration file set, and will accept extra command line parameters. It is not at all necessary, and the `booru-wizard` executable may be run directly directly.

   The images directory is where the actual images you wish to manage should be. The software produces its output in a series of .json files which correspond to each image file; these are sent to the output JSON directory. Finally, output files may be reopened, to restore the settings of your previous session; the input JSON directory is searched for these.

   Please refer to the [Interface Guide](#interface-guide) section for more information on using the software.

### Booru-mass-uploader

1. Install a userscript manager for your browser. Common choices are Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey, and Violentmonkey are the 3 popular options. Thus far, the testing for this software has been with Greasemonkey on Mozilla browsers.

2. The script can be acquired [here](https://netdenizen.github.io/Booru-mass-uploader/booru.mass.uploader.user.js). You should know the userscript manager has recognized it, since it will create a popup prompting to install.

3. Go to the supported \*booru of your choice. Currently, Gelbooru 0.1, Danbooru, and Moebooru based sites should be supported, but note that this software was adapted from a preexisting project, and I've only tested Gelbooru for my version. If the script is loaded, you should see a 'Mass Upload' link at the top of the page, or in the navigation bar.

4. The page should be largely self-documenting, but a quick overview is that '.JSON files:' serves a similar role to the input JSON files option for the booru-wizard, and 'Image files:' a similarly equivalent roles. The images you wish to upload should be selected by 'Image files:', while the corresponding JSON files should be selected by '.JSON files:'.

## Interface Guide

The basic interface of the software is as follows; each element is annotated with a green number:

![screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/lqt2KcU.png)

The image is divided into 3 panes, which can be resized within the window, by click-and-dragging the space between them. Note that text boxes with the same color as the background are not editable.

1. The name of the software and its current version.

2. The number of the current image.

3. The name of the current image.

4. The number of the current question.

5. The resolution of the current image.

6. The size of the current image file.

7. The amount of memory the loaded image takes up / The amount of memory all loaded images take up / The amount of memory available to hold loaded image data (The current image in the loaded image cache/The total number of images in the loaded image cache)

8. The current image quality. By default, the keybinds to cycle these left and right are respectively: Ctrl+shift+q and Ctrl+q. The options, the default keybinds to select them, and their descriptions are:

   `H2+1` : ctrl+g : Bicubic algorithm on upscaling, Box Average algorithm on downscaling
   `H2`   : ctrl+h : Bicubic algorithm; high quality, especially for upscaling
   `H1`   : ctrl+j : Box Average algorithm; high quality, especially for downscaling
   `M`    : ctrl+k : Medium quality Bilinear algorithm
   `L`    : ctrl+l : Lowest quality Nearest Neighbor algorithm

9. The time until any unupdated information is flushed to the hard drive.

10. A button to force unupdated information to be immediately flushed to the hard drive. This is disabled if there is none. The default keybind associated with this operation is F9.

11. The current zoom level relevant to the size of the image (The dimensions of the sampled area).

12. Zoom the image in. The default keybind associated with this operation is Ctrl+z.

13. Zoom the image out. It is impossible to zoom out past the point of fitting the window. The default keybind associated with this operation is Ctrl+Shift+z

14. Zoom the image to fit the window. It is impossible to zoom out past this point. The default keybind associated with this operation is Ctrl+f

15. Zoom the image to its actual size, or zoom level 1.0. The default keybind associated with this operation is Ctrl+Shift+f.

16. The current image is overlaid on a checkered transparency background.

17. The number of the current image. This can be changed to select an arbitrary one. The default keybind to select the field is F6.

18. The name of the current image. This can be changed to select another. Included is an autocomplete functionality, which will attempt to find the closest case insensitive match; possibilities will be listed in the menu. The default keybind to select the field is Shift+F6, and the default keybind to open the menu is Ctrl+Shift+F6

19. A search field to find questions. The search will be case insensitive, based on comma-separated keywords looked for in the descriptions of all questions. The default keybind to select the field is Shift+F7, and the default keybind to open the menu is Ctrl+Shift+F7.

20. The number of the current question. This can be changed to select an arbitrary one. The default keybind to select the field is F7.

21. Change to the 'left', or previous image. The default keybind associated with this operation is F1.

22. Change to the 'left', or previous question. The default keybind associated with this operation is F2.

23. Change to the 'right', or next image. The default keybind associated with this operation is F3.

24. Change to the 'right', or next question. The default keybind associated with this operation is F4.

25. The instructions or prompt for the current question are in this text box. The default keybind to select the field is F8.

26. The field in which the prompt at element 8 is answered. The default keybind to select it is F5.

## Building and Dependencies

The software is intended to run on Windows and Linux. A Mac port is a possibility, but it is a low priority, unless I find there is a great demand for it. Technically speaking, there is nothing in the code that I believe would make it incompatible, but I won't be actively maintaining and testing a port, for now. The library I used also seems to lack certain features on Mac.

Dependencies should not be an issue to the end-user, since the software will be packaged as a standalone executable along with the default configuration file, and a script to run the executable using that. Otherwise, the dependencies are:

* Python 3.2 or newer

* wxPython 4

* PyPubSub (Should be automatically included with wxPython)

* kanji_to_romaji3 (A Python 3 port I made of the kanji_to_romaji library, which can be found here: https://github.com/NetDenizen/kanji_to_romaji3)

* PyInstaller (For the officially supported build method.)

To satisfy all the dependencies, run:

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install wxPython PyPubSub PyInstaller
git clone https://github.com/NetDenizen/kanji_to_romaji3
cd kanji_to_romaji3
python3 -m pip install ./
```

To upgrade existing dependencies, run:

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip wxPython PyPubSub PyInstaller
git clone https://github.com/NetDenizen/kanji_to_romaji3
cd kanji_to_romaji3
python3 -m pip install --upgrade ./
```

To build with PyInstaller, use this command from the root directory of the repository:

`python3 -m PyInstaller --clean --onefile --windowed --strip --name booru-wizard main.py`

main.py can also be run directly with the booru-wizard files present in the same directory:

`python3 main.py`

## Development Roadmap

There are a number of features and changes which I consider for this software. These are listed both to solicit feedback from my users, and for my own planning.

### Unimplemented

* A color picker might be added to lend less ambiguity to the process of determining colors in images. A number of colors would be specified in the configuration file, and upon mousing over or clicking a pixel in the image, the closest 'match' among these colors would be shown.

* A scrollable menu of thumbnails for each image, which can be selected to change to a certain image might be handy for navigation. In the current state of the software, the user would need to remember the images by number, alone, to navigate to a specific one.

* Currently, the software only identifies which files to open by their name, allowing the metadata files to freely be applied to any image. This could be considered a useful feature since the information can be readily copied and transferred between images. On the other hand, it could lead to mistaken application of metadata to the wrong image.

  The solution I consider is to implement some sort of hashing to identify images. This could be a complex component of the software itself, and I am not sure it is within the scope of purpose for the software to act as a search engine.

### Open

* Especially in the case of imagesets, I consider that the same sequence of tags might be frequently repeated between multiple images. This raises the question as to if it should be possible to copy tags from one image to another. If not directly implemented, a string containing all tags, in a similar vein to the SESSION_TAGS option can be copy-and-pasted. - Implemented by SESSION_TAGS_IMPORTER; consider other options.

* I've considered adding more features to the image-viewer itself, such as the ability to zoom, and the ability to display animation. - Zooming implemented. Animation would likely involve complicated integration with ffmpeg libraries. wx animation support is too inconsistent between platforms. Specifically, the necessary methods are not supported for GTK.

* Currently, the software produces little in the way of command-line output which could be logged. What is logged, is typically from within the wxPython library. Aside from the command-line logging, such information could also be included in a window or other widget, or flushed to a file. - Basic command line logging implemented, especially for file operations.

### Finished

* The displayed image is resized to fit its area and the algorithm used for this will distort it, somewhat. wxPython provides multiple choices of algorithm, and I hard-coded in the highest quality, but slowest one. Users with less powerful computers might benefit from the ability to change this. - Quality settings implemented.

* The 'sashes' which are dragged to resize the window panes are also a bit poorly defined. I can probably change that. There also appears to be an issue with selections being entirely hidden, rather than highlighted in the uneditable fields (7 and 9). - Sizing modified to make the 'sashes' more distinct.

* Normally, the software periodically updates its output files, in case it suddenly crashes before its normal closing procedure would be done. Currently, this process runs in the background without any feedback to the user. I consider adding some kind of indication for it. - Flush timer and button added.
