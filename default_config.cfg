# The maximum amount of memory that can be used to cache images in bytes. This means they will be held in memory, which makes accessing them faster than reading them from the disk again.

# When transparent images are displayed, they are overlaid on a background of alternating-colored squares, like the ones typical of many image editors.
# Colors can be represented as a hexadecimal triplet of the format '#XXXXXX', or by the name of the format and the corresponding values, separated by spaces. For the latter case, 'rgb', 'hsv', and 'hsl' are supported (case-insensitive).

# Radio buttons allowing the user to choose between the safety ratings of 'Safe', 'Questionable', and 'Explicit'.
SAFETY_QUESTION:"What is the rating for this work? Follow these criteria:

Rating:Safe (Work-safe only)
- All art clearly lacking sexual content.
- Innocent romance between couples (kissing, hugging, eye_contact, etc).
- Tasteful swimsuits.
- Tasteful lingerie.
- Tasteful pantyshots.

Rating:Questionable
- Non-genital nudity, including exposed breasts, nipples, or areolae.
- Non-blatantly exposed genitals, full frontal nudity without additional \"action\" or bodily fluids.
- Covered_nipples/Erect nipples under clothing.
- Cameltoes and wedgies.
- Images in the middle of disrobing or torn_clothes that are designed to be sexually suggestive in nature.
- Sexually_suggestive acts (sucking suggestively on hotdogs, etc).
- Erections under clothes.
- Tag_group:sex_objects/Sex toys not being used, or hinted at or hidden under clothes.
- Mild sexual contact (ear_bite, breast_grabbing, saliva_trail/saliva-swapping, etc).
- Pubic_hair (while the rest of the genitals remain hidden).
- tag_group:sex_acts/Sex acts implied and hinted at, but not shown.
- Actual sex/intercourse, if portrayed in a restrained and tasteful manner (this can be tricky and is necessarily a judgement call, but if it concentrates on the act and omits anatomical details, it's likely okay)
- Implied or obscured bodily fluids (someone sitting on the toilet, somewhat wet_panties, etc. Again, this is a judgement call)
- Bondage, spanking and more general BDSM activities without insertion or bodily fluids.
- Other assorted erotica, as long as it doesn't cross the porn line. While rather hard to define precisely, the basic test is that of intent -- does it show just to show sex, or is it rather as a part of some other, normal human activity?

Rating:Explicit
- Blatantly exposed genitals (of either gender, censored or uncensored). \"Blatantly\" means in a way designed to draw the attention to the fact, by means of viewing angle or perspective. This includes spread_pussy / spread_anus, erection, etc.
- Openly and unambiguously portrayed tag_group:sex_acts/sex acts (including sex/intercourse, oral, fingering, handjobs, masturbation, etc). This includes censored images, as the presence of censorship makes it unambiguously clear what is happening behind that censor.
- Clearly visible sexual fluids (cum and pussy_juice)."
