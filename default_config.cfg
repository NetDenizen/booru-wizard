# Arbitrary whitespace can be between the colon and the key or value portions.

# The maximum amount of memory that can be used to cache images in bytes. This means they will be held in memory, which makes accessing them faster than reading them from the disk again. Note, that this is a limit at which image reservation will be halted; thus, it might be exceeded by the size of an image, before the limit is enforced. If 0, then caching is disabled.

# When transparent images are displayed, they are overlaid on a background of alternating-colored squares, like the ones typical of many image editors.

1. Is the image a photograph?

2. Does the image have a watermark? Not a signature or other identifying mark of the author, but identification blended into the image.

3. Does the work feature lolis or shotas? In the words of site staff: “We do not allow depictions of children in a state of undress, sexual, or suggestive manner.”. Check this forum post for further detail on interpretation of the rule: https://forum.booru.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1110

4. Is this work for sale, or behind a paywall (e.g. restricted to Patreon subscribers)?

SOURCE_QUESTION:"If possible, you are very strongly recommended to post your work with its original source listed, such that you may answer \"yes\" to all of the following questions.

1. Is the specified source where the author personally posted it or intended it to go?
2. Does the source provide the highest quality version of the image available? Note that an image originally posted as a lossy format (e.g. JPEG) will not gain quality if reposted as a lossless format (e.g. PNG), nor will it gain quality if it is resized.
3. Is the image you are uploading completely identical to the one provided by the source?
4. If sourcing a website, are you linking to a web page (where information associated with the image is readily available, if it exists), instead of directly to the image.

Explicit

Any image where the vagina or penis are exposed and easily visible. This includes depictions of sex, masturbation, or any sort of penetration.

Safe

Safe posts are images that you would not feel guilty looking at openly in public. Pictures of nudes, exposed nipples or pubic hair, cameltoe, or any sort of sexually suggestive pose are NOT safe and belong in questionable. Swimsuits and lingerie are borderline cases; some are safe, some are questionable.

Questionable

Basically anything that isn't safe or explicit. This is the great middle area, and since it includes unrated posts, you shouldn't really expect anything one way or the other when browsing questionable posts."
